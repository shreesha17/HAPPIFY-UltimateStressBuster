# HAPPIFY-UltimateStressBuster
An android application that helps to reduce stress of the corporate employees in a creative way.

we initially take the login credentials- name, age, company joining date, likes and dislikes of a person, their hobbies, field of interest etc.

We have categorized the field of interest into 4 categories namely sports, movies, music, nature and art.
Based on the interests of the employees, we create different chat groups where people of the same interests can communicate.
They get notified when frequent breaks are to be taken based on the peak hours.

We even give access to short clippings depending on the likes and dislikes they had specified. 
A common chat room is made for all the employees where they can post pictures, quotes, suggestions, viewpoints and ask for any help they want.
All of these ways can be highly effective in reducing the stress of employees.
